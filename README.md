# Mulligan Winrate

This is a Hearthstone Desktop Tracker plugin that shows the preferred mulligan based on the chosen deck and the data from HSReplay if the deck exists on HSReplay.

We would like to thank Red Hatter as we based this plugin on his [Graveyard plugin](https://github.com/RedHatter/Graveyard).

At the moment it does not have the features of Premium accounts for HSReplay. It returns the winrates for global winrates for all ranked standard levels, all regions.
