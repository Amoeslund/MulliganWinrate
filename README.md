This is a Hearthstone Desktop Tracker plugin that attempts to show the preferred mulligan based on the chosen deck and the data from HSReplay if the deck exists on HSReplay.
At the moment it does not have the features of Premium accounts for HSReplay. It returns the winrates for global winrates, not per class nor by level nor by region.
